In this humble contract Wallet, we keep a good use of the receive and fallback functions where the fallback only have to emit the wrong calls because the receive function is payable and can handle the good calls that are runned by the deposit functions. This way you managae well the deposit of ethers and the registration of balances, and the receive function does not use mush gas.
